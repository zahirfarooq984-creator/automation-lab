Absolutely! Let’s make a clear, step-by-step workflow for your automation lab, so you can load your environment and create a new project using newproj.sh.

Step 1: Open your terminal and navigate to your repo
cd ~/automation-lab


This ensures you’re in your main repo folder.

All projects will be created inside this folder.

Step 2: Activate your Python virtual environment
source ~/automation-lab-env/bin/activate


Your prompt should now show (automation-lab-env)

This ensures Python, Ansible, Netmiko, and other packages are available for your new project.

Step 3: Run the newproj.sh script

You have two options:

Option 1: Provide a project name directly

./newproj.sh my-new-project


The script will:

Create python/my-new-project/ folder

Add my-new-project.py with a Hello World message

Git add, commit, and push to GitHub

Ask if you want to open VS Code

Option 2: Let the script ask for the project name

./newproj.sh


The script will prompt:

Enter your new project name:


Type the name (e.g., test6) and press Enter.

It will then create the folder, script, commit, push, and ask about VS Code.

Step 4: Optional — open VS Code

If you answer Y to the VS Code prompt, it will open your repo in VS Code.

You can navigate to python/<project-name>/ and run/edit your Python file.

Step 5: Verify everything works

Run the Python script to check output:

python python/<project-name>/<project-name>.py


Example:

python python/test6/test6.py


You should see:

Hello from test6!


Check GitHub → your repo should have the new project folder and script.

✅ Summary Commands
cd ~/automation-lab
source ~/automation-lab-env/bin/activate
./newproj.sh                  # or ./newproj.sh project-name
python python/<project>/<project>.py


If you want, I can also make a tiny cheat-sheet you can keep on your desktop that lists all these steps as a one-page workflow — perfect for quick reference whenever you start a new project.
